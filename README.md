This example demonstrates the "multiple mutable borrows" error in Rust.  Rust's borrow checker prevents data races by ensuring that only one mutable reference to a given piece of data exists at any one time. Attempting to create multiple mutable references results in a compilation error. The solution shows how to refactor the code to avoid this error, ensuring data integrity and thread safety.
